## Welcome

I am Mike Sampson, a Linux Systems Administrator based in Sydney, Australia.

This is my personal blog of technology projects and random tid bits. It started
in 2009 as a WordPress blog hosted by an Arch Linux community member. I
eventually moved it to my own server and then later migrated it to Octopress. It
has most recently moved to a new domain and is now generated by Cobalt.rs.
