My work machine is currently running Windows 7. One of the features of Windows 7
I have been using is [Sticky
Notes](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/sticky-notes).
I believe there was a similar feature in Windows Vista though I never used it.
Sticky Notes are a virtual post-it note that appears on your desktop. You can
change the colour of each Sticky Note. I have been using them as todo lists and
have been surprised how much they help me to organise my time.

In the past I have organised my daily tasks through a combination of memory and
writing notes on the back of whatever piece of paper happens to be on my desk.
Suffice to say this is less than ideal. My memory fails me more often the older
I get and I often file or throw out items without realising I had written
something on the back of them. This is a real pain!

Sticky Notes has been so successful at work that I want something similar for
home use on my Linux machine. As I live in the terminal a console solution would
suit me best. At the moment I am considering:

  * [Vim](http://www.vim.org) with a todo.txt file.
  * [iKog](http://www.henspace.co.uk/ikog/index.html?second_topic.htm)

The Vim solution would be simple and closest to Sticky Notes though iKog does
provide a more structured environment for tracking todo lists. I haven't made up
my mind yet and will need to play with iKog more before doing so. It is an
interesting program and worth a look if you are looking for a console based todo
list manager. It has good documentation and many features such as searching and
outputting todo lists to html for printing.

iKog is available in the AUR [here](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=21440).
