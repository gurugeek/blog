A while back I published a post regarding [todo lists](http://blog.sambodata.com/?p=36). It has been a while but I have finally found a todo list manager. That is [VimOutliner](http://www.vimoutliner.org/). At first I doubted whether this would suit me however after using it for a while I don't know how I lived without it. Click on the thumbnail below for an actual size screenshot.

Useful features include:





  * Syntax highlighting.


  * Folding support.


  * Check boxes with percentage fields to track project completion.


  * Outlines are simply plain text files with an _.otl_ extension and can be converted to html and other formats.



Installation in Linux is a simple matter of running the supplied install script. I tried installing it in Vim on Windows 7 at work but was unable to get it to work. Will have to look into this. All in all I am very happy with it. It's check box management is great and very close to what I used to do manually with the addition of the automatically calculated weighted percentages. Any Vim users looking for an [Outliner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner) should check it out.
