A while back I published a post regarding [todo lists](http://blog.sambodata.com/?p=36).
It has been a while but I have finally
found a todo list manager. That is [VimOutliner](http://www.vimoutliner.org/).
At first I doubted whether this would suit me however after using it for a while
I don't know how I lived without it. Click on the thumbnail below for an actual
size screenshot.

Useful features include:

  * Syntax highlighting.
  * Folding support.
  * Check boxes with percentage fields to track project completion.
  * Outlines are simply plain text files with an _.otl_ extension and can be converted to html and other
    formats.

Installation in Linux is a simple matter of running the supplied install script.
I tried installing it in Vim on Windows 7 at work but was unable to get it to
work. Will have to look into this. All in all I am very happy with it. It's
check box management is great and very close to what I used to do manually with
the addition of the automatically calculated weighted percentages. Any Vim users
looking for an [Outliner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner) should check it
out.
