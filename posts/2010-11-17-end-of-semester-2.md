Haven't had time to post much of late due to the end of semester madness. I have been micro-blogging on twitter as [@mfsampson](http://twitter.com/#!/mfsampson) though. I have found twitter to be a great medium and a effective way of tracking news. Twitter's signal-to-noise ratio is high as long as you follow the correct people.

In other news I have transferred my configs to [github](https://github.com/mfs). While github has had a couple of issues with reliability [recently](https://github.com/blog/744-today-s-outage) it is a great service. Features like auto rendering of marked up readme files and the ease of use make it a unique service. So far I have enjoyed using it.

I'm enjoying the opportunity to read something other than text books and study notes and have read three chapters of "Coders at Work" by Peter Seibel. So far it has been a great read.
