Here are most of the books I read in 2015.

#### Fiction

[Seveneves][se] by Neal Stephenson would be my book of the year. Amazing story
split over 5000 years. Some of the themes have been seen before though they are
done well here.

[Gathering Prey][gp] is the latest Lucas Davenport novel by John Sandford. I
have read all the previous Davenport novels and enjoyed this one as well.
Interesting ending.

Many people, including the author, have compared [The Great Zoo of China][tgzoc]
by Matthew Reily to Jurassic Park. There is a similarity there for sure though
this books stands alone fine. This is classic Reily, non stop action.

I read two books by Lincoln Child. [Death Match][dm] and [Deep Storm][ds]. They
were OK. The ending of Death Match was a little hard to read as a technical
person.

While I have seen the movie many times I had never actually read [Jaws][j] by
Peter Benchley. Now I have. I was surprised to see the book contains many sub
plots that never made it into the movie. I really enjoyed it.

I love time travel stories and [Time and Time Again][tata] by Ben Elton is one
of the best I have ever read. Came across it by chance in a book store when I
was killing time one day.

I'm a huge fan of Michael Connelly and read two of his books in 2015.
[The Crossing][tc] and [The Burning Room][tbr]. Connelly's books have a sense
of realism that no other crime author gets.

I re-read [Eye of the Needle][eotn] by Ken Follett. It's one of my all time
favourite books. The movie is also great.

I have read all the Jack Reacher books by Lee Child. [Make Me][mm] is the
latest. This one is a little morbid though still a good read.

Read the book a couple of times and saw the movie. [The Martian][tm] by Andy
Weir is a unique book. If you only saw the movie and enjoyed it then read the
book. There were some great scenes left out of the movie.

#### Non Fiction

My non fiction reading was often security or software/hardware engineering
related.

I stumbled on [Silence on the Wire][sotw] by Michal Zalewski early in the year.
An interesting book covering multiple security vulnerabilities some of which are
fairly obvious in hindsight.

I had come across references to [The Soul of a New Machine][tsoanm] by Tracy
Kidder several times. I really enjoyed it and was surprised how advanced the
computers of the 70s were. For example the computer in question was 32 bit and
used micro-code.

While the previous book was about hardware, [Dreaming in Code][dic] by Scott
Rosenberg is about software. I wasn't familiar with Chandler and wasn't aware how
strongly Mitch Kapor supported open source.

I had read some of the Wired and Gawker articles about the Silk Road and wanted
to know more about this. [Silk Road][sr] by Eileen Ormsby was a fantastic read
and proved this whole story is complicated.

After reading Silk Road I wanted to know more about Bitcoin. I read [Mastering
Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies][mb] by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. It
gave a clear description of what Bitcoin is and how it works. Most of this
information would be available on the internet though it was nice to have it all
in one place.

During uni I wrote an assignment about Conficker and was surprised at it's
advanced construction. [Worm: The First Digital World War][worm] by Mark Bowden
covers Conficker in depth. Great story.

[Spam Nation][sn] by Brian Krebs was an eye opener. Many of the assumptions I
made about the spam industry were incorrect. This was an intriguing read.
