Just finished reading [Pirate Latitudes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lJ5Fe_vHF8) by the late Michael Crichton. It was an action packed read and reminded me of his earlier work "The Great Train Robbery". It is set in Jamaica during 1665 and describes the exploits of an English privateer, Captain Edward Hunter. Over all I enjoyed it immensely. Well worth a read if you are a fan of Michael Crichton, or pirates.
