As mentioned [previously](http://blog.sambodata.com/?p=162) my main laptop died. I'm currently writing this on my MacBook runing Arch Linux x86_64. I mainly used this machine for watching movies and websurfing with it running OSX. Installing Arch Linux went surprisingly well. Most hardware worked out of the box and unlike my HP this machine has Intel graphics. I'm glad to leave ATI behind. Intel and KMS are much more fun to play with.

Have been too busy to post much. Too many uni assignments to do. One due at midnight tonight. Better go and make sure it builds cleanly on uni's server.
