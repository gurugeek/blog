Cool, my very own Arch Linux blog courtesy of [crouse](http://archlinux.me/crouse/). Much appreciated. It has been a while since I have used [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org). It looks quite different, very impressive. I like the simplicity of the theme being used.

Don't plan on having much here that would be of interest to anyone but me but you never know. :) Have my final Uni exam for this semester coming up on Thursday. Should be able to have a play with WordPress after that.
