My main mouse died a while ago and in the meantime I have been using an old notebook mouse I had lying around. It doesn't have forward and back buttons which I find useful in Firefox. I decided to replace it today and am now using a [Logitech MX1100](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/mice_pointers/mice/devices/4676&cl=US,EN). This is another great mouse by Logitech. Some of its features are:




  * 8 buttons (including a stealth button) which all work in Arch Linux out of the box. No configuration required.


  * Adjustable sensitivity from 400-1600 dpi via buttons on mouse.


  * Uses two AA batteries though they are connected in parallel so if you can only find one battery it still works.


  * Indent or non indent scroll wheel modes activated by a button in front of the scroll wheel.


  * It's freaking huge! Having used notebook mice for so long I had gotten used to the small size of them but this is a well sized mouse for desktop use.



All in all I am very happy adding this mouse to my Logitech collection. I use a [Logitech VX Nano](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/mice_pointers/mice/devices/3271&cl=US,EN) on my laptop and a [Logitech VX Revolution](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/mice_pointers/mice/devices/165&cl=US,EN) at work.
