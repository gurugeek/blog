Stuck in a motel room watching [The Great Train Robbery](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079240) on pay tv. A great movie based on a great novel by the late [Michael Crichton](http://www.michaelcrichton.net/). Best quote from the movie:



> **Judge:** Now, on the matter of motive, we ask you: Why did you conceive, plan and execute this dastardly and scandalous crime?
**Edward Pierce:** I wanted the money. 



Just noticed on Michael Crichton's homepage that he still has two novels to be published later this year. Something to look forward to.
