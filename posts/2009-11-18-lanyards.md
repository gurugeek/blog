![Arch Linux lanyard.](/uploads/2009/11/lanyard.jpg)

Received my [Arch Linux lanyards](http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=82360) and they are pretty spiffy. Great value too. Only just realised I haven't posted an image in the short history of this blog so this is a good excuse.

One exam down and one to go. Internet Security was pretty much as expected, no surprises. Knowledge Management will probably be tougher. Still no luck accessing the student portal. Luckily my remaining unit doesn't use it however I will still need to access it to enrol for next year. Hope they get it sorted soon.
