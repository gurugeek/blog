![Arch Linux lanyard.](/images/lanyard.jpg)

Received my [Arch Linux
lanyards](http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=82360) and they are pretty
spiffy. Great value too. Only just realised I haven't posted an image in the
short history of this blog so this is a good excuse.

One exam down and one to go. Internet Security was pretty much as expected, no
surprises. Knowledge Management will probably be tougher. Still no luck
accessing the student portal. Luckily my remaining unit doesn't use it however I
will still need to access it to enrol for next year. Hope they get it sorted
soon.
