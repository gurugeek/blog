Sat my final exam for this semester. No surprises, think I did ok.

My main workstation pulled in 2.6.30 and the new nVidia driver yesterday but I held off on rebooting until today, after my exam. There seemed to be a few issues on the forums concerning 2.6.30 and/or the 185.18.14 nVidia driver. Didn't want to have to troubleshoot in the middle of cramming for exams.

Looks like I was being over cautious. Reboot was uneventful. It was also the first reboot since the new nfs-utils and rpcbind were installed. Graphics seem fine and my file server is accessible. Will see how 2.6.30 goes. Happy days! :)
