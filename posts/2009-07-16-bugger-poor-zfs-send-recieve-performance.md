Before installing OpenSolaris on my file server while I was running Linux I
noticed weird behaviour with the on board USB 2.0 controller of my ASUS A7V333.
For some reason I was only getting USB 1.1 transfer speeds with an external USB
hard drive. I didn't think much of it at the time however after trying a ZFS
send - receive I was getting awful performance on OpenSolaris too. A check of
the log files found this:

    Jul 16 21:34:26 argon usba: ... (ehci0): compatible USB products.

The fact I was experiencing trouble with this controller in Linux as
well doesn't give me a good feeling about using this workaround. I think I will
look around tomorrow for a USB PCI card.
