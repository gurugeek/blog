Recently replaced lighttpd with nginx on Debian squeeze. Used spawn-fcgi to manage PHP as php-fpm is not in squeeze yet. Had a little trouble with reliability until I set a couple of environment variables before spawning the PHP processes. Since using the script below to start php all has been well.


    
    #!/bin/bash
    PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN=2 \
    PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS=1000 \
    /usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -s /tmp/cgi-php.socket -u www-data -g www-data \
                        -P /var/run/cgi-php.pid \
                        -- /usr/bin/php5-cgi



 Next I would like to look at setting up varnish in front of nginx.
