Just installed Chromium	from the [AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=31368). So far it looks good. I have run Chrome in Windows but this is the first time I have run it in Linux. There are some nice themes available for it and it seems to be using my existing Firefox plugins without hassle.

Speaking of themes I came across a nice mouse cursor theme for X. It is called GT3 and is also available in the [AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=28533). This link is for the small variety which works best for me. A nice touch with this cursor package is that the text cursor fades out when selected. This makes it less noticeable while avoiding having to run unclutter or similar.
