Bugger! Shut my laptop down last night and when I booted it up this morning it seems to be dead. It's locking up, usually in the BIOS section though sometimes it gets as far as GRUB and once it made it to the console before locking up. This has been a great machine (Core 2 Duo) and I am sorry to see it go. It was happily running Arch Linux x86_64. The only downside to it was the ATI graphics. Not sure if I will replace it or maybe start using my netbook more. I'll have a better look at it when I get home. Curently traveling for work. Will arrive home later today.
