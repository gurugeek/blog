I'm planning on attending the [2011 linux.conf.au](http://lca2011.linux.org.au/) in Brisbane and there is now a draft schedule online. There are some great talks on offer including sessions by:





  * [Keith Packard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Packard) of X fame.


  * [Andrew Tridgell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tridgell) - original developer of samba and co-author of rsync.


  * [Sarah Sharp](http://sarah.thesharps.us/) - Linux kernel USB 3.0 subsystem developer. 


 
There are some great graphics related sessions and the mini-confs look interesting too. It should be a great event.
